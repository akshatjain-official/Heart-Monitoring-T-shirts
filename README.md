# Heart-Monitoring-T-shirts
The garment wirelessly transmits the wearerâ€™s heart rhythm to a mobile device and can accurately identify an unusual heart rhythm that could cause a sudden cardiac arrest. The monitoring T-shirt uses a single lead ECG and movement-reducing hardware to offer more accurate readings during exercise.
